Use Variables (VAR) to Avoid Repetition
Why: Every repeated calculation gets re-evaluated, even if the result doesn‚Äôt change.

Benefit: Improves readability and performance by storing intermediate results for reuse.

Example: Instead of calling CALCULATE(SUM(...)) twice, store it once in a variable.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Minimize Use of Row Context Functions (like FILTER, SUMX)
Why: Iterators like SUMX or FILTER can be powerful but expensive if misused over large tables.

Benefit: Prefer column-based aggregations (SUM, CALCULATE) when possible to reduce query execution time.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid Using ALL() Unless Necessary
Why: Removing filters with ALL() can increase computation overhead and lead to unexpected results in visuals.

Benefit: Keep your context tight for faster, more meaningful queries. Use REMOVEFILTERS() or ALLSELECTED() if you need more control.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-calculate and Stage Metrics if Reused Often
Why: Repeated logic across multiple measures increases load time and complexity.

Benefit: Create reusable base measures (like Total Sales, YoY Growth) and reference them. Modular design improves maintainability.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Leverage Time Intelligence Functions Smartly
Why: Calculating prior periods manually can slow performance and complicate your logic.

Benefit: Use built-in functions like DATEADD(), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), or PARALLELPERIOD() instead of custom logic‚Äîthey‚Äôre optimized under the hood.






Using DAX optimization tools like DAX Studio, Performance Analyzer, and Tabular Editor is like upgrading from a bicycle to a race car when working with Power BI models üèéÔ∏è. Each tool brings unique strengths to help you write better DAX, diagnose bottlenecks, and streamline your development workflow.
