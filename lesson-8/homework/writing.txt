1. In Power BI, DAX stands for Data Analysis Expressions. ðŸ§ 

Itâ€™s a specialized formula language designed for:

Creating custom calculations in Power BI, Excel Power Pivot, and SQL Server Analysis Services

Building powerful, dynamic measures and calculated columns

Enabling advanced data modeling beyond what basic formulas can do in Excel

ðŸ”§ Think of it like Excel formulas on steroidsâ€”optimized for working with large datasets, relationships, and time-based analysis

3. Calculated Column
Created row by row: Adds a new column to a table where each row has a value calculated using DAX.

Stored in the data model: The results are saved with the data, which means it takes up memory.

Useful for filtering and grouping: Can be used in slicers, visual axes, and to categorize data.

Measure
Calculated on the fly: Evaluated only when needed (e.g., when a report is generated).

Doesn't use memory the same way: Much lighter because itâ€™s not stored per row.

Perfect for aggregations: Used to sum, average, count, etc., often depending on context.
5. COUNTROWS() in DAX is a function used to count the number of rows in a table or table expression.
9. Circular Dependency Error in Power BI In Power BI, a circular dependency error happens when a calculated column relies on another column thatâ€”directly or indirectlyâ€”depends on the original column. Itâ€™s like chasing your own tail in logic: the calculation loops back onto itself, which Power BI canâ€™t resolve.

ðŸ’¡ Why it happens: Power BI needs to compute columns in a specific sequence, and it builds a dependency tree to figure out the order. If your formula creates a loop, Power BI gets confused because it canâ€™t decide which column to calculate first.
10. Filter Context
This kicks in when a calculation is performed in a measure, or during visual interactions like slicers or filters. It defines which rows are included in the calculation based on filters applied through visuals or DAX.
Row Context
This refers to the current row being evaluatedâ€”most commonly in calculated columns or iterators like SUMX, FILTER, etc. Itâ€™s like saying:
