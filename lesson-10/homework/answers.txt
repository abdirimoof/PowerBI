ALLEXCEPT()	✅ Yes (partial)	❌ No			Remove all filters except specified ones
ALLSELECTED()	✅ Yes	                ❌ No			Respect slicers, ignore visual filters
10. ALLSELECTED can behave unexpectedly in a pivot table because it depends heavily on user selections and visual context, which behave differently in pivot tables compared to other visuals like cards or bar charts.

14.Matrix visuals apply filters from added fields, which can change the context in which your measure is evaluated. This can interfere with internal logic that assumes a higher or flatter context.

✅ Fix: If needed, remove unwanted filters using REMOVEFILTERS or ALLSELECTED in your calculations.
